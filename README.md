# RxJChess
A fully frontend chess app built using React, Redux, and RxJs (hence the name!)

URL: [www.rxjchess.com](https://rxjchess.com)

## About This Project
I've spent many hours on lichess and chess.com. While I love these apps, I always felt it would be fun to build a chess app of my own, taking a visually richer approach to the design. Aside from the design aspect, I also wanted to try building a chess rules engine using a more functional approach with the help of Redux and RxJs (more specifically, redux-observables). So over a few weekends during the pandemic, I built RxJChess!

Currently the app offers 3 game modes: play a friend online, play the computer, or play over the board. The AI in the computer mode is powered by [js-chess-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-chess-engine).

## Future Plans
Since I built RxJChess more as an experiment than a fully developed product, I don't have any plans currently to continue working on it. However, if you find this and think it might be worthwhile to add additional functionality, please let me know and I'd be happy to take a look. Any other feedback is also welcome!
